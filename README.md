Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction using Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning

Machine Learning has continued to evolve since it commenced seven decades ago and 
subsequently has found itself an important application in the medical field. Cardio-
vascular diseases. Cardio-vascular diseases are claimed to be a major global health 
problem in modern medicine that is leading to almost 17.9 million deaths a year as of 2019 
which constitutes 32 percent of total deaths. Prediction of cardio-vascular diseases at a 
preliminary stage to prevent further complications and possibly, death, hence becomes
a necessity. Due to the convoluted nature of the factors and attributes involved in this 
disease, there exist a lot of possibilities of human fallacies and misconceptions. So, there 
is a dire need for technological advancement that can help medical researchers in the early
detection of this lethal disease and hence can recommend certain lifestyle changes to the 
patients to stop the inevitable development of these cardiovascular diseases. Recent 
healthcare research and studies have made a virtuous use of various cutting-edge 
techniques and advanced scientific methods to accurately diagnose and predict the disease 
based on the data received from the person. One such technology is Machine Learning 
which helps us in making smarter and more accurate predictions on the data. The major 
contribution of this research project is to find the machine learning classification 
approach that can give the best classification accuracy when it comes to the prediction of 
this disease. This research work is conducted on different machine learning classification
algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM, and Random Forest 
Algorithms. The dataset that we have based this research project on has been taken from 
Kaggle. The results and analysis of each stage of data modelling and classification are 
present in this study.
